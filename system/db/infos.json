    "description": "Lil Nas X was born as Montero Lamar Hill in 1999. His stage name combines \"Lil\" (a common naming trope for rappers), \"Nas\" from a Twitter account he ran while a devoted fan of Nicki Minaj and \"X\" as the Roman numeral 10 (the number of years he thought it would take to find fame). Nas has the social media savvy to make his work stand out in a crowded landscape, which helped with his breakthrough \"Old Town Road.\" Nas then created a meaningful, yet still attention-grabbing, first album: Montero (2021). The record contains hits like \"Industry Baby\" and \"Montero (Call Me by Your Name)\"; the personal tune \"Sun Goes Down\" addresses how a young Nas grappled with being gay. After being taught homosexuality was wrong when he was growing up, Nas conveys the message that he would like gay relationships to become so accepted by society that they are rendered unremarkable."

He is known for his atmospheric instrumental production which incorporates sound elements from nature and extensive use of jazz and soul samples. Ishi was born in Tokyo in 1962.

Ishi was inspired to start DJing after seeing the film Wild Style in 1983. \"When I discovered the film Wild Style in 1983 I found what I really wanted to do, to express myself,\" he said in a 2015 interview. \"Breaking, grafitti, rap, DJ… I always liked music so I chose DJ.

    "name": "DJ Shadow",
    "description": "DJ Shadow is a pivotal figure in the art of sampling. The Bay Area native's early solo work for the U.K. independent Mo' Wax label culminated in Endtroducing..... (1996), a hip-hop masterwork that incorporated obscure recordings spanning jazz, soul, funk, prog, psychedelia, and other forms, to filmic effect. Since co-piloting UNKLE's Psyence Fiction (1998) with Mo' Wax founder James Lavelle and moving a little farther out with his proper follow-up, The Private Press (2002), Shadow has confounded expectations with each successive step. Across The Outsider (2006), The Less You Know, The Better (2011), and The Mountain Will Fall (2016), the producer naturally distanced himself from using only recordings liberated from cramped record stores hazardous to his breathing. Among other unpredictable moves, he worked with rappers, singers, and fellow musicians ranging from E-40 to Tom Vek to Nils Frahm, embraced the local hyphy movement, and integrated gnashing metal and limpid folk. His scope widened even more with Our Pathetic Age (2019), a double album with separate instrumental and vocal sections. Josh Davis, the man known as DJ Shadow, grew up in the California towns of Hayward and Davis. A rare hip-hop fan in early-'80s suburbia, Davis gravitated toward the turntable/mixer setup of the hip-hop DJ over the guitars, bass, and drums of his peers. He worked his way through hip-hop's early years into the heyday of crews like Eric B. & Rakim, Ultramagnetic MC's, and Public Enemy, groups who prominently featured DJs in their ranks. Further inspired by the production advancements of Steinski and Mantronix, Davis started fiddling around with four-track beatmaking while he was in high school. While attending the University of California, Davis, he DJed at the college radio station and established the Solesides crew and label (with the likes of Blackalicious and Lyrics Born)."
