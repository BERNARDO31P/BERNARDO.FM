    "name": "Lil Nas X",
    "description": "Lil Nas X was born as Montero Lamar Hill in 1999. His stage name combines \"Lil\" (a common naming trope for rappers), \"Nas\" from a Twitter account he ran while a devoted fan of Nicki Minaj and \"X\" as the Roman numeral 10 (the number of years he thought it would take to find fame). Nas has the social media savvy to make his work stand out in a crowded landscape, which helped with his breakthrough \"Old Town Road.\" Nas then created a meaningful, yet still attention-grabbing, first album: Montero (2021). The record contains hits like \"Industry Baby\" and \"Montero (Call Me by Your Name)\"; the personal tune \"Sun Goes Down\" addresses how a young Nas grappled with being gay. After being taught homosexuality was wrong when he was growing up, Nas conveys the message that he would like gay relationships to become so accepted by society that they are rendered unremarkable."

Released in April 1995, The Infamous was released almost exactly a year after Illmatic and about half-a-year after Ready to Die -- the debut masterpieces of Nas and the Notorious B.I.G., respectively, and likewise albums of momentous significance for East Coast hardcore rap. On The Infamous, the duo of Prodigy and Havoc set the tone for future generations of hardcore New York rappers, from crews such as G-Unit and Dipset, to the likes of Ka and Roc Marciano. Subsequent Mobb Deep releases were equally influential, especially Hell on Earth (1996). The following decade, Prodigy and Havoc recorded for G-Unit -- the label of Mobb Deep disciple 50 Cent -- as well as numerous other outlets. The duo's partnership faltered for a time, but they were actively performing into mid-2017, when Prodigy died from complications of an illness that had afflicted him since infancy."
