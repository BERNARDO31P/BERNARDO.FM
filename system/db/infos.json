    "description": "Lil Nas X was born as Montero Lamar Hill in 1999. His stage name combines \"Lil\" (a common naming trope for rappers), \"Nas\" from a Twitter account he ran while a devoted fan of Nicki Minaj and \"X\" as the Roman numeral 10 (the number of years he thought it would take to find fame). Nas has the social media savvy to make his work stand out in a crowded landscape, which helped with his breakthrough \"Old Town Road.\" Nas then created a meaningful, yet still attention-grabbing, first album: Montero (2021). The record contains hits like \"Industry Baby\" and \"Montero (Call Me by Your Name)\"; the personal tune \"Sun Goes Down\" addresses how a young Nas grappled with being gay. After being taught homosexuality was wrong when he was growing up, Nas conveys the message that he would like gay relationships to become so accepted by society that they are rendered unremarkable."
