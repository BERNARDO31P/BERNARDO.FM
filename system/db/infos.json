    "name": "Lil Nas X - Montero Lamar Hill",
    "description": "Lil Nas X was born as Montero Lamar Hill in 1999. His stage name combines \"Lil\" (a common naming trope for rappers), \"Nas\" from a Twitter account he ran while a devoted fan of Nicki Minaj and \"X\" as the Roman numeral 10 (the number of years he thought it would take to find fame). Nas has the social media savvy to make his work stand out in a crowded landscape, which helped with his breakthrough \"Old Town Road.\" Nas then created a meaningful, yet still attention-grabbing, first album: Montero (2021). The record contains hits like \"Industry Baby\" and \"Montero (Call Me by Your Name)\"; the personal tune \"Sun Goes Down\" addresses how a young Nas grappled with being gay. After being taught homosexuality was wrong when he was growing up, Nas conveys the message that he would like gay relationships to become so accepted by society that they are rendered unremarkable."

    "name": "Xenoben",
    "description": "Xenoben is the stage name of UK-based Psychedelic Trance producer & DJ Benjamin Gildersleve.Ben’s passion for Psychedelic Trance started in London at the turn of the century when he attended some of the UK’s biggest Psytrance events. He turned from DJing to producing in 2012 and since then has released several tracks on CD and digital format and performed at various festivals.In May 2018, Xenoben released his first EP ‘Morning Daze’ on major label TesseracTstudio which smashed its way to the top of the Beatport Psytrance Releases chart. Later that year, a collaboration EP with Waveform also hit the number 1 position, earning Ben and his project more respect within the trance scene.Inspiration for his project is drawn from other talented UK producers and merged with the Serbian-style techniques of TesseracTstudio artists to produce clever and hypnotic polychrome atmospheres and trippy psychedelic vocal effects over intimidating heavy basslines.The future is bright for Xenoben with many singles, releases, collaborations and event bookings coming in the very near future."
